## Purpose of this game :

In this game, the user controls the mayor of a village, his goal is to reach a certain amount of money being 100,000, in this case the player wins the game.
However, if the player loses all his money or when he has no more villagers left, the player loses the game.

## Rules of the game :

The villages have NPCs that are divided into two categories:
The Poor
The Bourgeois

The role of the poor is to produce resources while that of the bourgeois is to generate income.
The poor will have to pay his taxes to the mayor thanks to the resources that he produces the other part thus serving him to feed himself.
The bourgeois pays him his taxes with his own income generated automatically, he will also have to pay for resources to feed himself.

NPCs will have one or more classes, depending on their category.

### POOR :
Lumberjack (Wood Product)
Butcher (Meat Product)
Baker (Bread Product)
Farmer (Wheat Product)
### BOURGEOIS :
Royal Family (AFK)
Artist (Painted)
Trader (Sells)
Craftsman (Made)

Each house is broken down into two large classes, the farms own 9 place and the castles 12 places. Add a woman increases the place of the house of 2 additional people.

## Player Actions :

The player will be able to constantly visualize the resources and the money he has.
At the end of each week the player will have a summary of production, he will have the choice of taxes imposed on the poor compared to the production made.
The player will also decide to give either more or less resources to the bourgeois against the money of them.
The mood of the poor varies according to the money given to them at the end of the week, if it is not enough the farmer loses his temper and risks dying at a certain stage.
The mood of the bourgeois varies in the same way but this time according to the resources he will receive at the end of the week.
There are therefore 3 mood stages:
Level 1
Level 2
Level 3
Depending on the mood level of the NPC, it will produce more or less resources / money.

At the end of the week, the mayor can add NPCs with the money he has, to produce more resources, he can also create houses that are indispensable to the arrival of new NPCs.
